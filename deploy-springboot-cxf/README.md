Convenience library for starting the SimplyRESTful API on a Tomcat server with Apache CXF using Spring Boot.

What this library does:
* Registers the JAX-RS providers required by SimplyRESTful.
* Makes the registered JAX-RS Web Resources available directly under the path `/services`.
* Generates an OpenAPI Specification document at `/services/swagger.json`
* Provides a Swagger UI at `/services/api-docs`.
    * Tip: If you access Swagger UI with `/services/api-docs?url=../swagger.json` it automatically loads the generated OpenAPI Specification file of the API.

## Usage
To use it in your project you have to:
* *Prerequisite: Your project should be [set up as a Spring Boot application](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/).*
* Depend on [`deploy-springboot-cxf`](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.github.arucard21.simplyrestful/deploy-springboot-cxf/)
* Implement your SimplyRESTful API according to the [standard instructions](/SimplyRESTful#usage).
    * You do not need to depend on the SimplyRESTful library directly as it is already pulled in by this library.
    * You do not have to follow the steps to configure your JAX-RS framework since this library takes care of most of that automatically.
* Make sure your implemented JAX-RS Web Resources can be detected by a Spring Component Scan.
    * A good way to do this is through auto-discovery of the classes. For this to work, annotate your Web Resource class with `@Named` (`jakarta.inject.Named`) and make sure it is located in a subpackage of the package containing your Spring Boot Application class (or the same package). Also enable the CXF component scan by configuring the application property `cxf.jaxrs.component-scan` to `true`, e.g. by adding the line `cxf.jaxrs.component-scan: true` in `application.yml`.
* Start your SimplyRESTful API by simply [running your Spring Boot application](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/#using-boot-running-your-application).
    * By default, Spring Boot runs the API on `http://localhost:8080/services/`.

See the [example project](/examples/springboot-cxf) for a simple example of how this library can be used.
